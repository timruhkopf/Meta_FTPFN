"""Per-dimension validation callback (M2) -- built specifically to check
the hypothesis in `docs/log/2026-08-31-variable-xdim-training-stagnation.md`:
does a variable-x_dim PFN's NLL/eval_mse genuinely get worse at higher
dimensionality (curse-of-dimensionality, expected), independent of whatever
`BNNPrior.active_dim` happens to be doing on any given training step?

Each dimension in `dims` gets its own **dedicated, fixed-x_dim** `BNNPrior`
(`variable_dim_min=None`), built ONCE by `build_dim_validation_callback`
and reused for every subsequent probe -- not rebuilt per call. `reset()` is
called exactly once per dedicated prior (at construction), never again, so
every probe against a given dimension samples fresh points from the *same*
fixed underlying random architectures throughout the whole training run --
the way a held-out validation set should behave, not a fresh random task
each time (which would make the reported curve noisier and harder to read
trends from).

**All dedicated priors share one `ecdf_sorted`, passed in rather than each
independently fit.** `BNNPrior._fit_ecdf` pools raw outputs across many
`reset()` draws, which already spans the training prior's own dimension
range when `variable_dim_min` is set (each draw resamples `active_dim`) --
but a *separately constructed* fixed-`x_dim` prior fitting its own ECDF
would calibrate only against ITS OWN dimension's raw-output distribution,
independently whitening it to [0,1]. Do that per dimension and the
comparison across dims stops being apples-to-apples: each dimension's y
gets rescaled to fill [0,1] on its own terms, which can mask genuine
cross-dimension difficulty differences rather than reveal them. ifBO's own
reference implementation avoids exactly this by using one static,
precomputed calibration array regardless of which dimensionality
(`num_features`) a given sample happens to draw
(`ifbo/priors/ftpfn_prior.py`'s `output_sorted.npy`, loaded once, searched
via `np.searchsorted` for every sample no matter its own `num_params`) --
so here too, every dedicated validation prior (and, by the same logic,
the training prior itself) shares the ONE ECDF that was fit once, at the
start, from a distribution that already spans the sizes in question.

Requires the model being validated to already accept the largest `dim` in
`dims` (i.e. `max(dims) <= trainer.model.max_x_dim`) -- checked eagerly at
build time, not discovered later at the first probe.

    `nll/val_dimN` and `mse/val_dimN` for each -- metric-type first, so
    MLflow's dashboard groups all NLL curves together (train's own
    `nll/train` alongside every `nll/val_dimN`), all MSE curves together,
    rather than one folder per dimension with both metrics buried inside
    it. Deliberately one `Callback` (not one per dimension): each probe
    already does one forward pass per dimension computing both metrics
    from the same `logits`, so splitting into a `Callback` per metric type
    would mean two independent forward passes (and two independent
    `sample_episode` draws) per dimension for no benefit.

    `ecdf_sorted`: shared normalization reference, `[1, ecdf_n_samples]`
    or `[B, ecdf_n_samples]` -- typically the TRAINING prior's own
    `ecdf_sorted` (see module docstring for why every dedicated validation
    prior must share one, not fit its own). Required, not optional --
    silently defaulting to "each dimension fits its own" is exactly the
    bug this module exists to avoid.

    `prior_kwargs` should mirror the training run's own `priors.*` config
    (`depth_range`, `width_range`, `log_amp_range`, `sparseness`, ...) so
    the comparison is apples-to-apples against the same task family --
    only `x_dim`/`variable_dim_min`/`batch_size`/`ecdf_sorted` differ per
    dimension here and are set internally; passing any of those four
    raises, since silently overriding a caller's explicit value would be
    more confusing than refusing. `every_n_steps=None` (default) uses the
    trainer's own `log_every` cadence (see `callbacks/handler.py`).

    `device`: must match the trainer's own model device -- these dedicated
    validation priors are built independently of the training prior (which
    the caller already put on the right device), so this doesn't default
    to anything inferred; a caller training on `cuda` and forgetting this
    gets a `RuntimeError` from the very first probe (`cuda`/`cpu` tensor
    mismatch), not silently-slow CPU validation."""

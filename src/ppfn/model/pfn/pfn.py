"""The PFN itself — ported near-verbatim from the tested prototype at
`archive/src/exit/claude/pfn-explore-exploit-repo/repo/src/model/pfn.py`.

Attention pattern (the whole point of a PFN, not an implementation detail —
see `archive/src/exit/PFN_ActionHead_ExpertIteration_Design.md`):
  * train tokens self-attend to train tokens only (bidirectional) -- this
    makes the train-token representations a permutation-invariant summary of
    the observed context, which is what a Bayesian posterior should be.
  * test tokens cross-attend to train tokens only -- never to each other,
    never to themselves. This prevents test-test leakage and makes every
    test point's prediction conditionally independent given the context,
    required for the PPD to be a valid predictive distribution point-by-point.

**`causal=True` (2026-09-08, off by default) trades exchangeability for
prefix-cacheability.** With it, train-train self-attention is masked
lower-triangular instead of bidirectional -- train token `i` only ever
attends to train tokens `1..i`. This is a genuinely different model, not a
toggle on an already-trained bidirectional checkpoint: it needs its own
pretraining run (`pipelines/train_pfn_causal.py`), and it gives up exact
permutation invariance (order now carries information a bidirectional
model's context representation deliberately can't). What it buys: one
forward pass over a full context now yields, at every layer, the *exact*
representation each prefix length would have produced on its own -- i.e.
`hidden_states[l][:, :i]` after processing `[0:i]` train tokens is
identical whether or not tokens `i+1:n` are appended afterward. That's what
makes genuine incremental KV-caching along a BO trajectory correct: a new
observation extends the cache rather than invalidating it, unlike the
bidirectional model where any change to `D_t` forces a full recompute (see
docs/PROBLEM_SETTING.md §PS.4 and docs/ROADMAP.md §7.4 for the cost
tradeoff this is answering).

Checked against PFNs4BO's own `TransformerModel.generate_D_q_matrix` (their
reference implementation, via a single mask fed into one homogeneous
transformer stack rather than separate self-/cross-attention modules): same
train-train / test-train pattern, except PFNs4BO's mask also lets each test
token attend to itself (an `eye` OR'd in, likely just to avoid an
all-masked row edge case in their more general code path). We deliberately
don't include that self-attention term — matches the design doc's "never to
themselves" more literally, and n_train >= 1 always holds here so there's no
degenerate all-masked-row risk to guard against.

**No physical `[T,T]` mask is materialized.** An earlier version of this
module concatenated train++test into one `[B,T,D]` sequence and ran a single
masked attention over the full `T x T` score matrix, relying on the mask to
zero out the train->test and test->test blocks. Those blocks are pure waste
-- always masked to -inf, never contributing a gradient -- but still cost
`O(T^2)` compute and (worse, memory-wise) an `O(B*h*T^2)` score tensor, which
is what was blowing up context/activation memory as n_train/n_test grew (the
reported symptom this rewrite responds to). Instead, train and test tokens
are kept as two physically separate tensors all the way through the block
stack, and each block runs two attention calls that share the SAME
`MaskedMHA` weights: `attn(train, train)` (bidirectional self-attention) and
`attn(test, kv_input=train)` (cross-attention). Structural separation makes
train->test and test->test attention impossible to compute at all, rather
than computed-then-discarded -- matching ifBO's
`ifbo/layer.py::TransformerEncoderLayer.forward`'s `isinstance(src_mask,
int)` branch (`src_left = self_attn(train,train,train)`, `src_right =
self_attn(test, train, train)`, both through the same `self.self_attn`
module), which does the same split for the same reason. One thing ifBO's
split path does NOT support: per-batch-item padding (it asserts
`src_key_padding_mask is None` whenever it takes this branch, since ifBO
always uses a single scalar `single_eval_position` shared across the whole
batch). We add that back in via `train_key_padding_mask` (see `MaskedMHA`
and `PFNBlock` below) so a batch can mix episodes with different n_train by
padding the train section out to a common width instead of forcing one
n_train onto the whole batch.

Implemented with one custom masked multi-head attention rather than
`nn.TransformerEncoderLayer`, because the encoder layer's API doesn't cleanly
express "two token types with an asymmetric, non-square attention pattern"
without fighting it. No positional encoding anywhere: train tokens must stay
permutation-invariant, and test tokens don't attend to each other so there's
nothing for a position to disambiguate. No TabPFN feature-wise attention —
deliberately simpler than PFNs4BO's own architecture there.

`self.bar_dist` (a `BarDistribution` submodule, built from `n_bins`) is
owned by the model itself, not constructed separately alongside it --
matches how other PFN implementations bundle the output distribution into
the model for deployment, and means `state_dict()`/checkpoint save-load
carries it automatically instead of every call site reconstructing a
(today, always uniform-border) `BarDistribution` by hand from `n_bins` and
hoping it stays in sync. `bar_dist.borders`/`bucket_widths` are buffers, not
parameters, so this doesn't add anything to `self.parameters()` or change
what the optimizer sees.

**Variable x_dim, still with no feature-wise attention.** `max_x_dim` is a
ceiling, not a fixed requirement: `train_embed`/`test_x_embed` are built
`max_x_dim`-wide, but any one episode may use fewer real dims
(`n_features[b] <= max_x_dim`, per batch item). This was a real design
choice, not a default: TabPFN's own variable-feature-count support
(`architectures/tabpfn_v2.py::AlongRowAttention`/`AlongColumnAttention`,
PriorLabs/TabPFN) is structural -- every (example, feature) pair is its own
token on a 2D grid, with a whole second attention axis between features at
every block, plus a persisted per-column embedding to break feature-order
symmetry -- because TabPFN is a zero-shot foundation model for *arbitrary*
tabular schemas, where column identity itself carries no fixed meaning
across datasets. That problem doesn't apply here: a BO run's `x_dim` is a
real, fixed hyperparameter space throughout that run, only varying *across*
episodes/tasks during training -- exactly PFNs4BO's and ifBO's own setting,
and neither of them use feature attention either. Both wrap their ordinary
dense per-example encoder in a `VariableNumFeaturesEncoder`
(`automl/PFNs4BO` and `automl/ifBO`, `encoders.py`, byte-for-byte identical
between the two): rescale by `num_features / x.shape[-1]` (a fan-in
correction -- a fixed-width Linear's fan-in shouldn't shrink just because
some of its input slots are zero-padded rather than real), then zero-pad up
to the fixed width their encoder was built for. `_pad_and_rescale_features`
below is that same encoder, generalized from their single batch-wide
`x.shape[-1]` to a per-batch-item `n_features` tensor, so a batch *could*
mix episodes with different real x_dim -- same idea as
`train_key_padding_mask` generalizing ifBO's own batch-wide
`single_eval_position` to per-item `n_train`. That per-item generality
isn't currently exercised by training, though: `priors/bnn.py`'s
`BNNPrior` (its `active_dim`/`active_dim_mask`, `variable_dim_min` option)
deliberately draws one **batch-uniform** active_dim, resampled fresh every
step -- matching ifBO/PFNs4BO's own batch-level convention instead, after
an earlier per-instance version was reverted (stagnated in training) --
`PFNTrainer` passes that batch-uniform value straight through as
`n_features`.

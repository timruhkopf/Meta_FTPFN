"""Frozen-PFN surrogate wrapper (docs/ROADMAP.md §M2) — the eval-time API
the rest of the project (M4's Q-head features, M7's baseline comparisons)
reads a trained PFN checkpoint through, rather than every caller poking at
`PFN`/`BarDistribution` directly. Wraps the existing `models/pfn.py`
architecture and `models/bar_distribution.py` output head; doesn't
reimplement either.

Derived scalars (`expected_improvement`/`probability_of_improvement`/
`mean_std` below) call straight through to `BarDistribution.ei`/`.pi`/
`.mean`/`.variance` (2026-09-08: ported onto that class from PFNs4BO's own
reference implementation — see `bar_distribution.py`'s docstring) rather
than reimplementing any of them here.

**Intra-step KV caching only (§2.11), by construction, not an explicit
cache object:** `PFN`'s train-side self-attention never depends on the test
tokens (`models/pfn.py`'s `PFNBlock`), so one batched `pfn(...)` call over
an entire candidate pool already computes the context representation once
and reuses it for every candidate — the same trick `pfn_ei_argmax` already
relies on. `predict()` below is written to always be called this way (one
call per whole candidate batch, never one call per candidate) — that's the
whole caching story; there is deliberately no cross-step cache (§2.11: the
context changes every step under bidirectional attention, so nothing from
a previous step's forward pass is reusable at the next one).

"""Vectorized, ECDF-normalized BNN prior — synthetic data-generating process
for the PFN, and, doubling as an environment.

Each of the B batch elements is an independently sampled random-architecture
tanh MLP (random depth, random width, width-compensated init scale) — a
fresh "true function" draw per element. Init scale is NOT sampled
independently of width — see `log_amp_range` below: most draws used to come
out flat until this was fixed by sampling
`depth * log(crit) = depth * log(init_std**2 * width)` directly (then
deriving `init_std`) instead, robustly across varying depth too.
Depth/width genuinely differ per element,
which is why this is NOT built on `torch.func.vmap`: vmap requires uniform
shapes/control flow across the mapped dimension, so a vmapped version would
still need every instance padded to the same (Lmax, Wmax) and masked down to
its actual (depth, width) — i.e. exactly what `_raw_forward` below already
does by hand via masked einsums. vmap would add an indirection layer without
buying either more expressiveness or measurably more speed here; it only
pays off if the whole batch shares one architecture (see
`archive/src/exit/prior/environment.py`'s `BatchedTaskFamily`, which does
exactly that — a simpler but less faithful setup, since the design calls for
each instance to be its own random architecture draw). Later, multistart GD
in the privileged search doesn't need vmap either: restarts are just extra
points along `evaluate`'s existing N (points-per-instance) axis.

Preactivation/output noise, fan-in input scaling, sparseness, and spurious
(irrelevant) input dimensions below are deliberately aligned with PFNs4BO's
(Müller et al., ICML 2023) and ifBO's (Rakotoarison et al., ICML 2024) own
BNN priors — sourced by reading both papers directly; input warping was
considered and deliberately not carried over (shelved).
